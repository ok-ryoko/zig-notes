# Ryoko’s Zig Notes #

This is [Ryoko]’s [digital garden] for v0.12.0 of the [Zig programming language].

The [notes](./notes) aspire to Andy Matuschak’s concept of [evergreen notes] and are synthesized primarily from:

- the [language reference];
- the [language source code] (mostly *Sema.zig* and test cases);
- discussion surrounding [language issues][ziglang/zig issues], and
- first-hand experience writing Zig.

The notes are a work in progress and may contain inconsistencies and errors.

## Scope ##

Ryoko hopes to cover all aspects of the Zig programming language in time. So far, she has written about [pointers](./notes/pointer.md).

## Contributions ##

Because these are Ryoko’s personal notes that represent her evolving mental model of Zig, she’s not accepting pull requests. (She can’t learn effectively from notes she didn’t write on her own.) However, she welcomes [issues] describing suggestions and pointing out errors.
